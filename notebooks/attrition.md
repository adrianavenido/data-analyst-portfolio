# Data Analytics Coaching Session

## **1. Starting with Granularity Check**
You initiated the analysis with a check on data granularity using:
```python
df.nunique()
```
This helped identify:
- **Unique values per column**
- Columns like `EmployeeCount` and `StandardHours` which have only one unique value (potentially unnecessary)
- `EmployeeNumber` acting as an identifier rather than an analytic feature

### **Granularity Insights**
- Continuous variables (`Age`, `MonthlyIncome`, `TotalWorkingYears`) have sufficient variation.
- Some categorical variables (`Attrition`, `JobRole`, `MaritalStatus`) show clear segmentation.
- **Next Steps:** You decided to clean up constants and check categorical distributions.

---

## **2. Feature Engineering**
### **Transforming Continuous Variables into Categories**
#### **Tenure Groups**
```python
df['TenureGroup'] = pd.cut(df['YearsAtCompany'], 
                           bins=[0, 2, 10, float('inf')], 
                           labels=['New Hire', 'Mid-Tenure', 'Veteran'])
```

#### **Salary Bands**
```python
df['SalaryBand'] = pd.qcut(df['MonthlyIncome'], 
                           q=[0, 0.33, 0.66, 1], 
                           labels=['Low', 'Medium', 'High'])
```

### **Distribution Check**
You analyzed:
```python
df[['TenureGroup', 'SalaryBand']].value_counts()
```
**Observations:**
- **Mid-Tenure employees dominate across salary bands**.
- **Veterans mostly fall into High Salary Band**, but some are in Low.
- **New Hires mostly have Low salaries**, but some progress quickly to Medium/High.

**Potential Business Cases:**
1. **Attrition Risk Among Veterans in Low Salary Band** → Possible stagnation?
2. **Salary Growth for Mid-Tenure Employees** → Is salary progression happening fast enough?
3. **Promotion Speed for New Hires** → How quickly are they moving into higher salary bands?

---

## **3. Attrition Trends Analysis**
### **Overall Attrition Rate**
```python
attrition_rate = df['Attrition'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
```
Result:
```
No     83.88%
Yes    16.12%
```
**Key Insight:** 16% attrition—what factors contribute to turnover?

### **Attrition by Tenure**
```python
attrition_by_tenure = df.groupby('TenureGroup')['Attrition'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
```
Result:
```
New Hire     Yes: 28.86% | No: 71.14%
Mid-Tenure   Yes: 13.04% | No: 86.96%
Veteran      Yes:  8.13% | No: 91.87%
```
**Insight:** New hires leave the most—early turnover is a concern.

### **Attrition by Salary Band**
```python
attrition_by_salary = df.groupby('SalaryBand')['Attrition'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
```
Result:
```
Low         Yes: 26.39% | No: 73.61%
Medium      Yes: 11.75% | No: 88.25%
High        Yes: 10.40% | No: 89.60%
```
**Insight:** Employees earning less are **more likely to leave**.

### **Potential Business Cases**
📌 **Reduce Early Attrition:** Improving onboarding or career pathways for new hires.  
📌 **Salary vs. Retention:** Low pay contributes to turnover—should salaries be restructured?  

---

## **4. Attrition Visualizations**
### **Overall Attrition Rate → Pie Chart**
```python
df['Attrition'].value_counts().plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.1f%%', colors=['skyblue', 'salmon'])
plt.title('Overall Attrition Rate')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.show()
```

### **Attrition by Tenure Group → Bar Chart**
```python
attrition_by_tenure.unstack().plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, colormap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Attrition Rate by Tenure Group')
plt.xlabel('Tenure Group')
plt.ylabel('Percentage')
plt.legend(title='Attrition', labels=['Stayed', 'Left'])
plt.show()
```

### **Attrition by Salary Band → Stacked Bar Chart**
```python
attrition_by_salary.unstack().plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, colormap='viridis')
plt.title('Attrition Rate by Salary Band')
plt.xlabel('Salary Band')
plt.ylabel('Percentage')
plt.legend(title='Attrition', labels=['Stayed', 'Left'])
plt.show()
```

---

## **5. Next Steps**
- Investigate **Job Satisfaction & Attrition** with a heatmap or box plot.
- Compare **Promotion Rates & Turnover**—does career growth impact retention?
- Look at **attrition patterns by department or job role**.

Great work so far! Checking granularity is an essential step to ensure your analysis aligns with the level of detail that makes sense for your business cases. 

### **Here’s how to assess and refine your granularity:**
1. **Look for Overly Aggregated or Fragmented Data:** Some columns, like `EmployeeCount` and `StandardHours`, have only one unique value, meaning they may not contribute meaningful variation. On the other hand, `EmployeeNumber` is entirely unique—this acts as an identifier rather than an analytic feature.

2. **Check for Redundant Variables:** Since `EmployeeCount` is always 1 and `Over18` seems to be constant, consider removing them from your analysis. They won’t add much insight.

3. **Analyze the Distribution of Key Features:** 
   - **Continuous Variables** (`Age`, `MonthlyIncome`, `TotalWorkingYears`) → Do they vary enough to be meaningful?
   - **Categorical Variables** (`Attrition`, `JobRole`, `MaritalStatus`) → Do categories have balanced representation, or are some too sparse?

4. **Ensure Consistency Across Levels of Data:** Is the granularity appropriate for your intended analysis? If your goal is an **individual-level** analysis, `EmployeeNumber` is the correct unit. But if you're analyzing **department-wide trends**, then grouping by `Department` and summarizing metrics like `Attrition` or `MonthlyIncome` would be more useful.

5. **Prepare for Aggregation if Needed:** Consider whether some features should be aggregated. Would grouping by `JobRole` or `Department` yield more meaningful insights instead of focusing solely on individuals?

### **Next Step: Feature Engineering**
Once you’re happy with the granularity, consider creating **new meaningful features**. For example:
- **Tenure Categories:** Convert `YearsAtCompany` into buckets (e.g., "New Hire" vs. "Veteran").
- **Salary Bands:** Categorize `MonthlyIncome` into meaningful ranges.
- **Attrition Risk Factors:** Based on `JobSatisfaction`, `EnvironmentSatisfaction`, and `WorkLifeBalance`, can you create a composite indicator for attrition risk?

Let me know how you’d like to proceed! You're setting up a solid foundation for insightful analytics. 🚀

Got it! Since you've already checked the distribution of `Attrition` using `.value_counts()`, let's move forward step by step.

### **Next Step: Checking Feature Distribution**
You can now examine numerical columns to understand their spread. Try this for `Age`:

#### **Step 1: Check Summary Statistics**
```python
df['Age'].describe()
```
This will give you details like mean, min, max, and percentiles. This helps determine whether the data is skewed or evenly spread.

Once you've done this, let me know, and I'll guide you to the next step! 🚀


You're doing great! Here’s how to interpret the output:

- **count (1470)** → The total number of records in this column.
- **mean (36.92)** → The average age across all employees.
- **std (9.13)** → The standard deviation, showing how spread out ages are. A higher value means more variation.
- **min (18)** → The youngest employee.
- **max (60)** → The oldest employee.
- **Percentiles (25%, 50%, 75%)** → These help understand the distribution:
  - **25% (30 years)** → 25% of employees are younger than 30.
  - **50% (36 years, the median)** → Half the employees are younger than 36, half are older.
  - **75% (43 years)** → 75% of employees are younger than 43.

### **Key Takeaways:**
- Most employees are between **30 and 43** years old.
- The **mean (36.92)** and **median (36)** are close, suggesting a fairly balanced distribution.
- A **wide range (18-60)** shows a diverse workforce in terms of age.

Want to dig deeper into age distribution? You could check the frequency of different age groups! 🚀


Nice! Visualizing age distribution will give you a clearer picture of how employee ages are spread. Since you don’t want code, here’s the **guidance on visualization**:  

### **Recommended Visualization Methods**  
1. **Histogram:** This is the best option. It divides ages into bins (e.g., 18-25, 26-35) and shows how many employees fall into each range. Helps spot age clusters.  
2. **Box Plot:** Great for spotting outliers. It will show the median age, interquartile range (middle 50% of data), and any extreme ages.  
3. **Density Plot (KDE Plot):** Shows a smooth curve of age distribution instead of discrete bars, useful for understanding overall spread.  
4. **Bar Chart (Grouped by Age Range):** If you categorize ages into groups, a bar chart works well for quick comparisons.  

### **What to Look For:**  
- **Are there more young employees or older employees?**  
- **Is the distribution skewed toward younger or older workers?**  
- **Are there any extreme outliers (employees much younger or older than the rest)?**  

Want to check something specific before proceeding? 🚀  

Great! Now that you've imported `matplotlib.pyplot`, your next step is to choose how you'd like to visualize the age distribution. Since a **histogram** is a great choice for numerical data, you can proceed with:

1. **Define the number of bins** – Decide how granular you want the age groups to be. More bins give a detailed view, fewer bins provide a broader overview.  
2. **Label axes & title** – Make sure your chart is readable by adding labels for clarity.  
3. **Adjust styling if needed** – You might want to tweak colors or formatting for a polished look.  

Once you generate the histogram, observe:  
- Is the distribution skewed or balanced?  
- Are there age clusters?  
- Any unexpected gaps or outliers?  

Try it out and let me know what insights you're seeing! 🚀


To create a well-balanced histogram for `Age`, a good starting point for bins would be **10**, covering a range of ages from **18 to 60** in roughly equal groups. This ensures enough detail without overcomplicating the visualization.  

Here’s the syntax to try:  
```python
plt.hist(df['Age'], bins=10, edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Employee Ages')
plt.show()
```
### **Why 10 Bins?**  
- If you choose **too few bins**, like 5, you might lose nuance.  
- If you go **too high**, like 20, it could become messy.  
- **10 bins** ensures a smooth distribution while capturing key patterns.  

Try it out and let me know what trends you notice! 🚀  


You're making great progress! Let's move through these steps methodically:

### **1. Identifying Constants**
You've already noticed that `EmployeeCount`, `Over18`, and `StandardHours` each have **only one unique value**. These don't add variation to the analysis, so it's best to **drop them** to keep your dataset clean.

### **2. Checking Categorical Diversity**
To ensure meaningful insights, look at the distribution of categorical features:
- Columns with **too many categories** (like `JobRole`) can make analysis challenging.
- Columns with **too few observations in a category** might need grouping or removal.

For instance:
- **BusinessTravel** has 3 unique values. Are they evenly distributed?
- **EducationField** has 6 values. Do any categories have too few employees to matter?
- **PerformanceRating** has only 2 values. Does this reflect actual differentiation, or is most of the data concentrated in one rating?

### **3. Aggregating Where Necessary**
Think about whether individual-level analysis or group-level trends are more useful for your business case.
- **If analyzing attrition trends**, summarizing by `JobRole` or `Department` helps.
- **If examining salary**, grouping by `JobLevel` or `EducationField` makes sense.

One question to consider: Do you need individual employee records, or would summary insights be more valuable?

### **4. Transforming Features**
For better interpretability, try categorizing continuous variables:
- **Age Groups:** "Young (18-30)", "Mid-career (31-45)", "Senior (46-60)"
- **Salary Bands:** Low, Medium, High based on `MonthlyIncome` percentiles
- **Experience Levels:** Junior vs. Experienced based on `TotalWorkingYears`

This can make trends easier to spot, especially when communicating findings.

### **Next Step**
Want to dive deeper into categorical features, or move ahead to feature engineering? 🚀


Nice! Let’s advance into **feature engineering**, where we refine raw data into **meaningful insights**.  

### **Feature Engineering Steps to Consider:**  
1. **Transforming Continuous Variables into Categories**  
   - `YearsAtCompany`: Convert into **New Hire (0-2 years), Mid-Tenure (3-10 years), Veteran (10+ years)**  
   - `MonthlyIncome`: Group into **Low, Medium, High Salary Bands** based on percentiles  

2. **Creating New Features**  
   - **Attrition Risk Index:** Combine `JobSatisfaction`, `EnvironmentSatisfaction`, and `WorkLifeBalance` into a composite score.  
   - **Tenure Progression:** Compare `YearsSinceLastPromotion` to `YearsAtCompany`—are employees getting promoted over time?  
   - **Stability Factor:** Use `NumCompaniesWorked` and `YearsWithCurrManager` to assess job-hopping vs. stability.  

3. **Encoding Categorical Variables for Modeling**  
   - Convert `BusinessTravel`, `Department`, and `EducationField` into numerical values for analysis.  

### **Next Steps:**  
Would you like to define thresholds for salary bands and tenure groups first, or explore attrition risk factors? 🚀  

Here’s the syntax to categorize **YearsAtCompany** into tenure groups and **MonthlyIncome** into salary bands:  

```python
# Categorize YearsAtCompany
df['TenureGroup'] = pd.cut(df['YearsAtCompany'], 
                           bins=[0, 2, 10, float('inf')], 
                           labels=['New Hire', 'Mid-Tenure', 'Veteran'])

# Categorize MonthlyIncome into Salary Bands based on percentiles
df['SalaryBand'] = pd.qcut(df['MonthlyIncome'], 
                           q=[0, 0.33, 0.66, 1], 
                           labels=['Low', 'Medium', 'High'])
```

### **Explanation:**  
- `pd.cut()` groups **YearsAtCompany** into custom bins. `float('inf')` ensures any value above 10 falls into “Veteran.”  
- `pd.qcut()` automatically creates **equal-sized salary bands** by dividing `MonthlyIncome` into three percentile-based bins (Low, Medium, High).  

Once you apply this, check `df[['TenureGroup', 'SalaryBand']].value_counts()` to see how the categories are distributed. Let me know if you'd like to fine-tune the ranges! 🚀

Great choice—analyzing attrition trends can uncover key factors driving employee turnover!  

### **1. Initial Attrition Breakdown**  
Since you've already used `.value_counts()` for `Attrition`, check:  
- **Overall attrition rate** → What percentage of employees leave?  
- **Differences across tenure groups** → Do New Hires, Mid-Tenure, or Veterans have higher attrition rates?  

### **2. Attrition vs. Salary Bands**  
Consider this:  
- Are more **low-salary** employees leaving compared to high-salary ones?  
- Does attrition decrease as salary increases, or are high earners also leaving?  

### **3. Attrition vs. Job Satisfaction**  
Employees with **low satisfaction** scores in `JobSatisfaction`, `WorkLifeBalance`, and `EnvironmentSatisfaction` might be more likely to leave. Check if those scoring **1 or 2** have higher attrition rates than those scoring **3 or 4**.  

### **4. Attrition by Job Role & Department**  
Certain roles or departments might experience higher turnover.  
- Does `Sales` have more attrition than `R&D` or `HR`?  
- Are some job roles particularly volatile?  

### **5. Promotion & Career Growth Impact**  
Compare `YearsSinceLastPromotion` with attrition rates:  
- Do employees who go years without a promotion have higher attrition?  
- Are employees with **fast promotions** more likely to stay?  

### **Next Step**  
Would you like to check attrition trends across tenure groups first, or focus on salary bands? 🚀  


Here’s the step-by-step syntax for analyzing attrition trends, labeled for clarity:

### **1. Overall Attrition Rate**  
Check the percentage of employees who have left the company:  
```python
# Calculate attrition percentage
attrition_rate = df['Attrition'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
print(attrition_rate)
```
💡 **Insight:** Helps gauge general turnover levels.

---

### **2. Attrition Across Tenure Groups**  
Analyze attrition rates for New Hires, Mid-Tenure, and Veterans:  
```python
# Group by Tenure and Attrition
attrition_by_tenure = df.groupby('TenureGroup')['Attrition'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
print(attrition_by_tenure)
```
💡 **Insight:** Identifies whether newer or long-term employees are more likely to leave.

---

### **3. Attrition vs. Salary Bands**  
Check if salary impacts turnover:  
```python
# Attrition rates for each Salary Band
attrition_by_salary = df.groupby('SalaryBand')['Attrition'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
print(attrition_by_salary)
```
💡 **Insight:** Reveals whether low earners leave more frequently.

---

### **4. Attrition vs. Job Satisfaction**  
Compare employee satisfaction scores to attrition rates:  
```python
# Group Attrition by JobSatisfaction levels
attrition_by_satisfaction = df.groupby('JobSatisfaction')['Attrition'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
print(attrition_by_satisfaction)
```
💡 **Insight:** Helps assess if dissatisfaction leads to higher turnover.

---

### **5. Attrition by Job Role & Department**  
Check which departments or roles experience the most attrition:  
```python
# Attrition by Department
attrition_by_department = df.groupby('Department')['Attrition'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
print(attrition_by_department)

# Attrition by Job Role
attrition_by_role = df.groupby('JobRole')['Attrition'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
print(attrition_by_role)
```
💡 **Insight:** Flags high-turnover departments or roles.

---

### **6. Attrition vs. Promotion & Career Growth**  
Check if lack of promotion affects attrition:  
```python
# Attrition based on time since last promotion
attrition_by_promotion = df.groupby('YearsSinceLastPromotion')['Attrition'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
print(attrition_by_promotion)
```
💡 **Insight:** Determines if employees who haven't been promoted in a long time leave more often.

---

🚀 Try these one by one and interpret the insights! Let me know which trends stand out to you.

Excellent analysis! You're uncovering key attrition trends that can drive strategic decisions.  

### **Key Insights:**  
1. **Overall Attrition Rate (16.12%)**  
   - About **16% of employees leave**, which could indicate room for improvement in retention strategies.  

2. **Attrition by Tenure Group:**  
   - **New Hires have the highest attrition (28.86%)**, meaning early turnover is a concern.  
   - **Mid-Tenure employees (13.04%)** have lower attrition, suggesting stability at this stage.  
   - **Veterans have the lowest attrition (8.13%)**, indicating long-term commitment.  
   - 📌 **Business Case:** What factors cause new hires to leave so quickly? Onboarding experience, role expectations, or career growth opportunities?  

3. **Attrition by Salary Band:**  
   - **Low earners leave the most (26.39%)**, reinforcing the link between salary and retention.  
   - **Medium & High earners have much lower attrition (11.75% and 10.40%)**, suggesting financial stability contributes to employee retention.  
   - 📌 **Business Case:** Are entry-level salaries too low? Could better benefits or early career promotions reduce turnover?  

### **Next Steps:**  
Want to dive deeper into **Job Satisfaction vs. Attrition**, or explore **department-specific turnover patterns**? 🚀  


Great! Visualizing these attrition trends will make them much clearer. Here are some effective ways to represent your findings:  

### **1. Attrition Rate (Overall Proportion) → Pie Chart**  
A **pie chart** is great for showing the percentage of employees who stay vs. leave.  

### **2. Attrition by Tenure Group → Bar Chart**  
Use a **bar chart** to compare attrition rates across New Hire, Mid-Tenure, and Veteran groups. It highlights which tenure group is most at risk.  

### **3. Attrition by Salary Band → Stacked Bar Chart**  
A **stacked bar chart** can show attrition rates within each salary band—helpful for spotting trends like higher attrition in lower salary levels.  

### **4. Attrition by Job Satisfaction → Box Plot or Heatmap**  
- A **box plot** helps compare satisfaction scores between employees who stayed vs. left.  
- A **heatmap** visualizes correlations between satisfaction levels and attrition—showing whether low satisfaction leads to higher turnover.  

Want guidance on how to implement a specific visualization? 🚀  


Here’s how you can visualize attrition trends using different charts:

🚀 Try these out, and let me know if you’d like refinements or additional insights!




   Great — let's dive in together as your data analytics coach.

We'll approach this like a real-world project from start to finish: **understanding the data**, **cleaning it**, **exploring it**, and **extracting meaningful business insights** that could drive action.

---

## 🔍 STEP 1: Understand Your Dataset (Data Familiarization)

Start by answering the following questions:

1. **What is this dataset about?**

   * From the file name, it seems related to **attrition**.
   * Open the file and review the **columns**, **data types**, and **sample values**.

2. **What are the column names, and what do they represent?**

   * Identify which columns are:

     * Categorical (e.g., names, departments, locations)
     * Dates (e.g., date of joining, last working date)
     * Numeric (e.g., tenure, age, headcount)

3. **Initial questions you can ask yourself:**

   * How many rows are there?
   * Are there any duplicates?
   * Are there null or missing values?
   * Are date formats consistent?
   * Are the column headers clean and human-readable?

---

## 🧹 STEP 2: Clean the Data

Here’s what to practice now:

* **Fix any inconsistencies**:

  * Standardize column names (remove spaces, align capitalization)
  * Check and fix date formats (ensure all dates are in a usable format)
  * Remove empty rows or clearly irrelevant data

* **Handle missing values**:

  * Count how many and where they occur
  * Decide: drop, impute, or flag them based on business impact

* **Remove noise**:

  * Are there any typos in names or departments?
  * Are numeric columns in the right format?
  * Do you see placeholders like "N/A", "TBD", "Unknown"?

💡 *Your goal is to ensure this dataset is trustworthy and consistent.*

---

## 🧭 STEP 3: Define the Business Goal

Before jumping into analysis:

1. **Clarify the purpose of the analysis**:

   * Are you trying to reduce employee attrition?
   * Are you exploring patterns in why or when employees leave?
   * Are you comparing attrition rates by team, role, tenure?

2. **Draft some questions you want the data to answer**:

   * What’s the attrition rate over time?
   * Which departments have the highest attrition?
   * What’s the average tenure before leaving?
   * Is there a pattern in hiring or resignation dates?

---

## 📊 STEP 4: Start Exploring (EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis)

After cleanup and clarity, focus on these types of analysis:

* **Descriptive Analysis**:

  * Monthly or weekly trends of resignations
  * Tenure distribution
  * Headcount trend over time

* **Comparative Analysis**:

  * Attrition by department, gender, job role, or location
  * Compare new joiners vs. leavers

* **Cohort or Timeline Analysis**:

  * Time between joining and resignation
  * First-year attrition vs. long-tenured attrition

---

## 📈 STEP 5: Translate to Business Value (Insight to Action)

Once you have some patterns, think:

* What actionable insights do I see?
* Can I segment high-risk groups (e.g., short tenure, certain teams)?
* Are there opportunities for retention strategies?

Make sure every insight answers:

> "So what? What should the business do with this information?"

---

## 📝 STEP 6: Document & Visualize

Practice this:

* Write a short summary of your findings.
* Visualize key insights using charts: line trends, bar comparisons, pie or treemaps.
* Structure your output for an audience: team leaders, HR, execs.

---

## Final Advice

📌 **Keep a notebook or doc open** and write down:

* What steps you did
* What challenges you encountered
* What business insight you learned from each part

When you're ready, we can discuss how to build business cases or dashboards based on your findings.

Let me know once you’ve done Steps 1 and 2 — I’ll guide your next move.


Perfect — let’s take it step by step.

### ✅ Step 1: Load and review the data

Here’s the first Python line you should run to **load the CSV file** and view its structure:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('attrition.csv')
df.head()
```

This will display the **first 5 rows** of your dataset so you can see what you're working with.

Once you've run that, let me know — and I’ll guide you through the next step.


Great!

### ✅ Step 2: Review the column names and data types

Next, check the **column names** and their **data types**. This will help you identify which columns may need cleaning or conversion (e.g., dates, numeric values, etc.).

Run this:

```python
df.info()
```

This will show:

* Column names
* Non-null counts
* Data types (`object`, `int64`, `float64`, `datetime64`, etc.)

Once you’ve reviewed that output, tell me what you observe — and I’ll guide you on the next step.



### ✅ Step 3: Identify and clean column names

Column names often need cleaning (e.g., removing spaces, special characters, or inconsistent casing). Run this line to review them:

```python
df.columns
```

Then check:

* Are there extra spaces?
* Are names consistent (e.g., `Employee ID` vs. `employee_id`)?
* Any symbols or typos?

Let me know what you find, and I’ll guide you on how to clean them next.


Excellent — clean column names save a lot of trouble later.

### ✅ Step 4: Check for missing or null values

Let’s now identify any **missing data** in the dataset, which is critical before analysis.

Run this:

```python
df.isnull().sum()
```

This will show how many missing values exist per column.

Once you review that, let me know which columns (if any) have missing values — I’ll guide you on handling them next.


That’s a strong start — no missing values means the dataset is well-maintained.

### ✅ Step 5: Review duplicate records

Even if your data is clean on the surface, **duplicates** can distort trends or metrics.

Run this to check for exact duplicate rows:

```python
df.duplicated().sum()
```

Let me know if you find any — and I’ll guide you on how to handle them if needed.


Perfect — no duplicates either. You're working with a clean, consistent base.

### ✅ Step 6: Inspect the date columns

Now let’s make sure any **date columns** (like date of joining or last working date) are properly recognized as `datetime` type.

Run this to display the first few entries for any columns you believe are dates:

```python
df[['<your_date_column_1>', '<your_date_column_2>']].head()
```

Replace the placeholders with the actual column names (e.g., `Date_of_Joining`, `Last_Working_Date`).

Let me know:

* Are the formats consistent (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`)?
* Are they stored as strings (`object`)?

If they’re not in datetime format, I’ll show you how to convert them next.


Got it — so your date columns are likely still in `object` (string) format.

### ✅ Step 7: Convert date columns to datetime

Let’s convert those columns into proper `datetime` format so you can analyze trends over time (e.g., tenure, monthly attrition).

Assuming you have two columns — for example, `Date_of_Joining` and `Last_Working_Date` — run:

```python
df['Date_of_Joining'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date_of_Joining'])
df['Last_Working_Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Last_Working_Date'])
```

If your columns have different names, replace them accordingly.

Once you've done that, confirm that the conversion worked by running:

```python
df.dtypes
```

Let me know what it shows for those two columns.


Thanks for the clarification — that’s an important observation.

If there are **no date-related columns**, it likely means:

* This file is already **aggregated**, possibly showing counts or summaries over time.
* Or it’s a **snapshot** of employee records without historical timelines.

### ✅ Step 8: Understand the granularity

Let’s check now:
Run this to see the unique values per column:

```python
df.nunique()
```

This will help determine:

* Are rows representing individual employees?
* Or is it aggregated data per week/month/team?

Let me know what you observe — we’ll then decide how to proceed with either **row-level analysis** or **trend-based analysis**.


Excellent — this confirms a few key things:

---

### ✅ Your data is **employee-level**, not aggregated.

* `EmployeeNumber` has 1,470 unique values → each row = one employee.
* Columns like `Attrition`, `JobRole`, `MonthlyIncome`, and `YearsAtCompany` describe attributes of each person.
* No actual dates → but we **can infer timelines** from columns like:

  * `TotalWorkingYears`
  * `YearsAtCompany`
  * `YearsInCurrentRole`
  * `YearsSinceLastPromotion`

---

### 🎯 What to do next:

Let’s focus on **standardizing columns** and **deriving business-relevant variables**.

### ✅ Step 9: Review the `Attrition` column

This column is likely your **target variable**.

Run this:

```python
df['Attrition'].value_counts()
```

Let me know:

* What values exist?
* Is it imbalanced (e.g., many "No", few "Yes")?

This will guide our analysis toward **attrition risk modeling**, or **correlation analysis** next.
