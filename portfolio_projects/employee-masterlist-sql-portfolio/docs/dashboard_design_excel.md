If your employee data includes location information (e.g., city or municipality within the National Capital Region), you can create a map chart in Excel:

- Prepare a column with location names (e.g., "Quezon City", "Makati", etc.).
- Summarize employee counts or other metrics by location.
- Select your summarized data and insert a **Map Chart** via `Insert > Charts > Maps`.
- Excel will visualize the distribution of employees across the National Capital Region.

> **Note:** Map charts require Excel 2019 or Microsoft 365 and an active internet connection for geocoding.
