# **Employee Management Database - Troubleshooting Log**
**Author:** _Your Name_  
**Date:** _May 28, 2025_  
**Database Name:** `employee_management`

## **Challenges & Errors Encountered**
During this session, the following issues were encountered:

### **1. Foreign Key Constraint Errors**
- **Error Message:**  
  `"Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails"`
- **Cause:**  
  - Attempted to assign an employee to a `team_leader_id` or `cluster_manager_id` that didn‚Äôt exist yet in their respective tables.
- **Solution:**  
  - Verified existing IDs in `team_leaders` and `cluster_managers` before inserting employee assignments.
  - Used `SELECT * FROM team_leaders;` and `SELECT * FROM cluster_managers;` to confirm valid IDs.

---

### **2. Auto-Increment ID Confusion**
- **Issue:**  
  - Manually assigned `team_leader_id` and `cluster_manager_id` values instead of allowing MySQL‚Äôs `AUTO_INCREMENT` to generate them.
- **Solution:**  
  - Removed manually assigned values and let MySQL handle ID generation.
  - Used `SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();` to confirm new entries.

---

### **3. Disabling Foreign Key Checks Temporarily**
- **Discussion:**  
  - Used `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;` to bypass foreign key constraints when inserting assignments.
  - While it allowed inserts, it was considered a **temporary workaround** rather than a permanent fix.
- **Solution:**  
  - Instead of disabling constraints, ensured correct insertion order:  
    1. Insert `lines_of_business`
    2. Insert `cluster_managers`
    3. Insert `team_leaders`
    4. Insert `employees`
    5. Insert `employee_assignments`

---

### **4. Incorrect Table References in Joins**
- **Error Message:**  
  `"Unknown column 'team_leader_id' in 'where clause'"`
- **Cause:**  
  - Misreferenced `team_leader_id` when joining tables, assuming it was directly linked in `employees` instead of going through `employee_assignments`.
- **Solution:**  
  - Corrected the query to properly **JOIN `employee_assignments` first** before `team_leaders`:
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, tl.first_name AS Team_Leader
FROM employees e
JOIN employee_assignments ea ON e.employee_id = ea.employee_id
JOIN team_leaders tl ON ea.team_leader_id = tl.team_leader_id;
```

---

### **5. Creating a View for Employee Assignments**
- **Issue:**  
  - Needed a **predefined query structure** that avoided manually writing complex joins.
- **Solution:**  
  - Created `employee_assignment_view`:
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_assignment_view AS
SELECT 
    e.employee_id, 
    e.first_name AS Employee_First_Name, 
    e.last_name AS Employee_Last_Name, 
    e.gender, 
    e.location, 
    CONCAT(tl.first_name, ' ', tl.last_name) AS Supervisor_Name,
    cm.name AS Cluster_Manager_Name, 
    lob.name AS Line_of_Business, 
    ea.assigned_date
FROM employees e
JOIN employee_assignments ea ON e.employee_id = ea.employee_id
JOIN team_leaders tl ON ea.team_leader_id = tl.team_leader_id
JOIN cluster_managers cm ON ea.cluster_manager_id = cm.cluster_manager_id
JOIN lines_of_business lob ON tl.lob_id = lob.lob_id
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
```
- **Outcome:**  
  - Successfully created a reusable view to simplify queries.

### **6. Funny/Silly Moments**
üí° _Some unexpected but insightful moments during the session:_
- **Sorting employees by birth date instead of team leader.**  
  - Ended up grouping employees by age rather than by department hierarchy.
  - Lesson learned: *Always double-check sorting conditions!*
- **Mistakenly assuming MySQL was ‚Äúrejecting‚Äù valid inserts.**  
  - Turns out the team leader ID didn‚Äôt exist yet.  
  - Lesson learned: *MySQL enforces its rules, and it's not personal!*
- **Asked ‚ÄúWhy does SQL hate me?‚Äù after multiple failed queries.**  
  - Turns out every failed attempt helped refine the database logic.
