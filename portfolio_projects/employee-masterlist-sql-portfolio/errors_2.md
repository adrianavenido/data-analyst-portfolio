# üõ†Ô∏è Employee Termination Audit Logging ‚Äî Troubleshooting & Solution

## üìã Problem Summary

We needed to track and log all **changes to the `termination_date` field** in the `employees` table, including:

* New termination dates being set
* Existing termination dates being updated
* Termination dates being cleared (set to `NULL`)

Additionally, this audit trail needed to include:

* Old and new `termination_date`
* Old and new `is_active` status
* Timestamp of change
* User who made the change

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue Diagnosed

### 1. **Trigger Not Firing on NULL Changes**

Initial trigger logic used:

```sql
IF OLD.termination_date != NEW.termination_date
```

But this failed to detect changes from `NULL` ‚û°Ô∏è date, due to SQL‚Äôs behavior:

```sql
NULL != '2025-05-15' ‚Üí NULL (not TRUE)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Corrected Trigger Logic

### 1. **Trigger Drop and Replace**

We updated the trigger to explicitly detect all types of changes to `termination_date`.

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS log_termination_changes;

DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER log_termination_changes
AFTER UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Log if termination_date was added, changed, or removed
    IF (OLD.termination_date IS NULL AND NEW.termination_date IS NOT NULL)
       OR (OLD.termination_date IS NOT NULL AND NEW.termination_date IS NULL)
       OR (OLD.termination_date IS NOT NULL AND NEW.termination_date IS NOT NULL AND OLD.termination_date != NEW.termination_date) THEN

        INSERT INTO termination_audit_log (
            employee_id,
            previous_termination_date,
            new_termination_date,
            previous_is_active,
            new_is_active,
            change_timestamp,
            changed_by
        ) VALUES (
            NEW.employee_id,
            OLD.termination_date,
            NEW.termination_date,
            OLD.is_active,
            NEW.is_active,
            NOW(),
            USER()
        );

    END IF;
END;
//

DELIMITER ;
```

## üß™ Test Case Examples

| Old `termination_date` | New `termination_date` | Logged? | Description                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| `NULL`                 | `'2025-06-01'`         | ‚úÖ Yes   | New termination added       |
| `'2025-05-01'`         | `'2025-06-01'`         | ‚úÖ Yes   | Termination date changed    |
| `'2025-06-01'`         | `NULL`                 | ‚úÖ Yes   | Termination removed/cleared |

## üßæ `termination_audit_log` Table Structure

Make sure this table exists and accepts NULLs:

```sql
CREATE TABLE termination_audit_log (
    audit_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT,
    previous_termination_date DATE,
    new_termination_date DATE,
    previous_is_active TINYINT(1),
    new_is_active TINYINT(1),
    change_timestamp DATETIME,
    changed_by VARCHAR(100)
);
```

---

## üìå Notes

* Trigger type: `AFTER UPDATE`
* Logic checks for changes involving `NULL`, which is not equal to anything (including itself)
* Use `USER()` to log the session user who performed the change
* This does not update `is_active` ‚Äî that should be handled in a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger or generated column if needed

---

## ‚úÖ Query to View Logs

```sql
SELECT * FROM termination_audit_log
ORDER BY change_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## üîÑ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

* Track changes to `termination_reason`
* Add approval flow fields (e.g., `approved_by`, `approved_at`)
* Notify HR/admin via email or alert on termination changes
* Automatically set `is_active = 0` in a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger
