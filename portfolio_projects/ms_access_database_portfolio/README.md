Sure! Here's a clean, simple Markdown (`.md`) documentation for your Access login form:

# Login Form Documentation

## Overview

This Microsoft Access Login Form provides basic user authentication by validating the username and password against records stored in the `UserAccount` table. It also controls access based on the user's security level, directing users to different tables depending on their roles.

## Table Structure

### UserAccount Table

| Field Name    | Data Type  | Description                       |

| EmployeeName  | Text (50)  | Full name of the employee         |
| UserName      | Text (100) | Username for login                |
| Password      | Text (100) | User password                     |
| SecurityLevel | Text (100) | User role (e.g., "User", "Admin") |

## How the Login Process Works

1. **Validation Checks:**

   * The form first checks if the **username** or **password** fields are empty.
   * If empty, a message box prompts the user to fill in the missing information, and sets focus to the empty field.

2. **User Authentication:**

   * The form uses `DLookup` to check if the combination of username and password exists in the `UserAccount` table.
   * If the credentials do not match, it notifies the user with an error message and clears the input fields.

3. **Security Level Check:**

   * Upon successful authentication, the form retrieves the `SecurityLevel` for the user.
   * Based on the `SecurityLevel`, it opens different tables:

     * `"User"` level opens the **EmployeeData** table.
     * `"Admin"` level opens the **Admin** table.
   * If the security level is unknown, an error message is shown.

4. **Form Closure:**

   * After successful login and opening the appropriate table, the login form closes without prompting to save design changes.

## VBA Code Summary

```vb
Private Sub Command18_Click()
    ' Validate inputs
    ' Authenticate user
    ' Check security level
    ' Open corresponding table
    ' Close login form without saving design changes
End Sub
```

## Notes

* **Password Storage:** Currently, passwords are stored as plain text in the database. For better security, consider implementing hashing.
* **SQL Injection:** The code handles single quotes in input to reduce SQL injection risk, but consider using parameterized queries for improved security.
* **User Experience:** After login, the form closes automatically, preventing unnecessary save prompts by using `acSaveNo`.

## How to Use

1. Open the database.
2. Enter your username and password.
3. Click the login button.
4. If credentials are correct, access the relevant data table.
5. If invalid, follow the prompt to re-enter credentials.
