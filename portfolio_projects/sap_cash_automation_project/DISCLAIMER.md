# Disclaimer

This project contains simulated code and dummy data that recreate the logic and workflow of a real-world automation I developed during my tenure at a previous employer. The original scripts and data were proprietary and are not included.

All logic was created manually before ChatGPT's public release (November 30, 2022), using research and debugging through online resources like Stack Overflow. This demonstrates my skills in real-world process automation using Python and SAP scripting.
